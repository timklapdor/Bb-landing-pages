# Updates

## 8 June 2016

- changed Clear function from ```<br>``` to ```<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>``` as Blackboard was removing. 
- Added new image Size classes - 80% - 40% width for cases where 100% width is not viable.
- Added new columm configurations to Readme to simplify creation of new content.
- Tweaks to padding and margins in profiles - h4 removes space around, h6 adds extra space - should normalise spacing.
- Tweaks to spacing in Single Profile - added padding to bio text paragraphy, removed from contact list
- Added ```clear: both;``` to DIVs for sections. Should stop some of the overflow and bleed issues associated with H4 colour.
