## 8 June 2016

- changed Clear function from ```<br>``` to ```<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>``` as Blackboard was removing. 
- Added new image Size classes - 80% - 40% width for cases where 100% width is not viable. [Bottom of the page](http://timklapdor.github.io/Bb-landing-pages/inline-images.html)
- Added new columm configurations to Readme to simplify creation of new content. [Bottom of the page](https://github.com/timklapdor/Bb-landing-pages/blob/gh-pages/readme.md#columns)
- Tweaks to padding and margins in profiles - h4 removes space around, h6 adds extra space - should normalise spacing. 
- Tweaks to spacing in Single Profile - added padding to bio text paragraphy, removed from contact list
- Added ```clear: both;``` to DIVs for sections. Should stop some of the overflow and bleed issues associated with H4 colour.
